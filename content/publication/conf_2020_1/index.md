abstract: This paper investigated the implementation of smartphone mobile application in assisting teaching and learning towards low achiever’s student in tertiary education. Specifically, this study concentrated on teaching and learning mathematics in English at tertiary level where English is considered as a second language in Malaysia and used as a medium of instruction in the learning process at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM). Unbalanced quasi pre and post-test experimental design was used in this study to determine the impact of English medium mathematics mobile application towards the performance of low achievers’ students. This study limited the participation of the students to students whose scores were under the low achiever’s category only. As such, students who entered the undergraduate’s diploma program through a special entrance program (i.e., the MDAB program under UiTM) were selected in this study. These students were divided into two groups, one of which used the mobile application (Treatment Group, n = 24) and the other one did not used the mobile application (Control Group, n = 27). Bayesian t-test using JASP open-source statistical software was carried out to test the existence of significant change in students’ performance based on the marks they scored on a test for a specific topic before and after the introduction of mobile applications in students learning process. Based on the analysis carried out, results show that the treatment group which introduced the use of mobile application in learning process had a slightly better performance compared to the control group. In the future, it is recommended that a specific mobile application is developed respective to the syllabus content and introduced in the early schooling process in order to fill the students with a better understanding on the fundamental concepts before they enter the tertiary education.
